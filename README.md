Web crawler using Async library. Concurrent workers has been set to 5 and I hadn't connection pooling from request libary. It is completely asynchronous.
I have used async.queue to process and extract the urls. Please clone the repository and do install the dependencies and run the app. Crawled urls are written asynchronously into file.csv in the repository.
